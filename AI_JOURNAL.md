# State
- Only the backend has been developed
  - Why? 
    - Too broad requirements for 2h work and AI does not work properly for broad goals, so it has not sense of goals.
    - I focused on getting minimal requirements to work decently.
    - I focused in providing a project easy to asses.
- Some issues still in the backend.

# Misc
- I decided the tooling and specified it to the agent (check /.cursor).

# Tooling
Cursor with 'Composer 1' model
