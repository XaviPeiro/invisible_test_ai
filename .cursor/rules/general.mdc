# Policies
- Add the minimum number of test that ensures the code is working as defined in the 'FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS'.
- Use standard patterns in every technology you use.
- Always ask when for confirmation when you add a new technology (as MongoDB, pytest, nginx, etc...).
- Keep a README.md updated about how to execute the application.
